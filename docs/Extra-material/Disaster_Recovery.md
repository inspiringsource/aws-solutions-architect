## RPO and RTO Explained

RPO: Recovery Point Objective

Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is the maximum amount of data loss that a business is willing to tolerate. For example, if an RPO of 24 hours is set, then the business is willing to lose up to 24 hours of data.

RTO: Recovery Time Objective

Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is the maximum amount of time that a business is willing to tolerate for its systems to be unavailable. For example, if an RTO of 4 hours is set, then the business is willing to tolerate up to 4 hours of downtime.
