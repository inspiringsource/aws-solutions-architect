# Amazon DevPay

Amazon DevPay is a simple-to-use online billing and account management service that makes it easy for businesses to sell applications that are built in, or run on top of, Amazon Web Services. It is designed to make running applications in the cloud and on demand easier for developers.

Amazon DevPay removes the pain of having to create or manage your own order pipeline or billing system, which is traditionally a challenge for online subscription services or applications running on demand. It allows you to quickly sign up customers, automatically meter their usage of AWS services, have Amazon bill them based on the prices you set, and collect payments. Amazon DevPay provides a simple web interface for pricing your application based on any combination of up-front, recurring and usage-based fees. It uses Amazon Payments to process payments from your customers, and lets you leverage Amazonâ€™s trusted billing infrastructure, making it easy for tens of millions of Amazon customers to pay for your application using their existing Amazon accounts.
