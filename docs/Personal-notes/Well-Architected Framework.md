title: Well-Architected Framework

---

The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps you understand the pros and cons of decisions you make while building workloads on AWS. By using the Framework you will learn architectural best practices for designing and operating reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective workloads in the cloud. It provides a way to consistently measure your architectures against best practices and identify areas for improvement. We believe that having well-architected workload greatly increases the likelihood of business success.

## The AWS Well-Architected Framework is based on six pillars:

- [Operational Excellence](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/operational-excellence-pillar/operational-excellence-pillar.html)
