title: Well-Architected Framework

---

The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps you understand the pros and cons of decisions you make while building workloads on AWS. By using the Framework you will learn architectural best practices for designing and operating reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective workloads in the cloud. It provides a way to consistently measure your architectures against best practices and identify areas for improvement. We believe that having well-architected workload greatly increases the likelihood of business success.

## General design principles

1. Stop guessing capacity
2. Test systems at scale
3. Automate
4. Plan for evolution
5. Drive architecture using data
6. Improve through game days

While these design principles are important to follow as a whole in the AWS Well-Architected Framework, there are additional considerations when developing and building your architecture. The AWS Well-Architected Framework provides this guidance through the lens of six pillars. Each pillar provides their own set of design principles. Think of it as layers. The top layer encompasses the general design principles. The next layer would be each of the six pillars, and underneath each pillar is a set of design principles.

## The six pillars:

- [Operational Excellence](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/operational-excellence-pillar/operational-excellence-pillar.html)
- [Security](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/index.html)
- [Reliability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/foundations.html)
- [Performance Efficiency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/performance-efficiency-pillar/foundations.html)
- [Cost Optimization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/cost-optimization-pillar/foundations.html)
- [Sustainability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/sustainability-pillar/foundations.html)
