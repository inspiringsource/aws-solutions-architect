The multi-tier application (three-tier, n-tier)

How AWS can be used to change the way you design multi-tier architectures and implement popular patterns such as microservices, mobile backends, and single-page applications. Architects and developers can use Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and other services to reduce the development and operations cycles required to create and manage multi-tiered applications.

## Three-tier architecture

A three-tier architecture is a client-server architecture in which the user interface, application processing, and data management functions are physically separated. The three tiers are the presentation tier, the application tier, and the data tier.
