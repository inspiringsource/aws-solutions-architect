You can use lifecycle rules to define actions that you want Amazon S3 to take during an object's lifetime (for example, transition objects to another storage class, archive them, or delete them after a specified period of time).

## Lifecycle rules examples

Amazon S3 to transition a subset of objects to the S3 Standard-IA storage class 30 days after creation.

```
<LifecycleConfiguration>
    <ID>Archive Rule</ID>
    <Filter>
      <Prefix>logs/</Prefix>
    </Filter>
    <Status>Enabled</Status>
    <Transition>
      <StorageClass>STANDARD_IA<StorageClass>
      <Days>30</Days>
    </Transition>
   </Rule>
</LifecycleConfiguration>
```
