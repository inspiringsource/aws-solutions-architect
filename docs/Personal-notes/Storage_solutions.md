## AWS offers several different storage types

*this secition should be included in the storage section*
Object storage is a type of data storage that is designed for storing and retrieving unstructured data, such as photos, videos, and documents. AWS's object storage service is called <a href="../Services by category/Storage/page-S3">Amazon S3</a> (Simple Storage Service). It allows users to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web.

Block storage is a type of data storage that is designed for use with traditional, file-based applications. AWS's block storage service is called <a href="../Services by category/Storage/page-EBS">Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)</a>. It allows users to create and attach virtual storage volumes to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances. These volumes can be used as raw block devices, and can be formatted with a file system of the user's choice.

File storage is a type of data storage that is designed for use with file-based applications, such as network-attached storage (NAS) and distributed file systems. AWS's file storage service is called <a href="../Services by category/Storage/page-EFS">Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)</a>. It allows users to create and mount file systems that can be accessed by multiple Amazon EC2 instances at the same time.
