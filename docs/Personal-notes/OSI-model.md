## The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model)

The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes and standardizes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology. The OSI model partitions a communication system into abstraction layers. A layer serves the layer above it and receives services from the layer below it. A layered system can be implemented in different ways as long as the layering concept is maintained. The OSI model is used to guide the development and evolution of communication protocols. It is used to describe the functions of a communication system and to classify protocols according to their scope. The OSI model is also used to describe the architecture of communication systems and computer networks.

## The seven layers of the OSI model are:

- Layer 7: **Application** - The application layer is the top layer of the OSI model. It is the interface between the user and the network. The application layer is responsible for the presentation of data to the user and the formatting of data for transmission. T
- Layer 6: **Presentation** - The presentation layer is responsible for the translation of data between different formats. It is also responsible for encryption and compression of data.
- Layer 5: **Session** - The session layer is responsible for the establishment and termination of sessions between communicating applications.
- Layer 4: **Transport** - The transport layer is responsible for the reliable transmission of data between applications. It is also responsible for the segmentation and reassembly of data.
- Layer 3: **Network** - The network layer is responsible for the routing of data between different networks. It is also responsible for the addressing of data packets.
- Layer 2: **Data Link** - The data link layer is responsible for the reliable transmission of data between adjacent network nodes. It is also responsible for the framing of data.
- Layer 1: **Physical** - The physical layer is responsible for the transmission of raw bits over a physical medium.
