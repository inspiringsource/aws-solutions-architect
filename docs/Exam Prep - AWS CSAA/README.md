# Course Outline

In this course, the instructors cover all four knowledge domains that are tested in the exam. It's important to understand that on the exam, questions from all domains are presented in random order. 

### Week 1: Designing Resilient Architectures (Domain 1)    

This week, you will get an overview of relevant concepts and services for Designing Resilient Architectures (Domain 1). For this domain, question walkthroughs cover designing a multi-tier architectural solution, designing highly available or fault-tolerant architectures, and decoupling mechanisms by using AWS services. In addition, this week features an optional hands-on exercise for this domain so that you can practice creating a serverless architecture with an AWS Lambda function. The Lambda function inserts a test item into an Amazon DynamoDB table and uploads a test object to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. An accompanying video walkthrough shows one possible solution for addressing the requirements for the exercise.

### Week 2: Designing High-performing Architectures (Domain 2) 

This week, you will review relevant concepts and services for Designing High-performing Architectures (Domain 2) so you can get a benchmark of your knowledge in this area. Question walkthroughs for this domain address the topics of identifying and selecting storage, network, and database solutions that are elastic, scalable, and high performing. An optional exercise for Domain 2 gives you an opportunity to practice creating a virtual private cloud (VPC) with two public subnets and two private subnets. You will then launch an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance into the public subnet. This exercise has an accompanying video walkthrough that shows one possible solution for completing the exercise.

### Week 3: Designing Secure Applications and Architectures (Domain 3) 

This week, you will get an overview of relevant concepts and services for Designing Secure Applications and Architectures (Domain 3) so you can get a benchmark of your knowledge in this area. For this domain, the question walkthroughs focus on designing secure access to AWS resources, designing secure application tiers, and selecting the appropriate data security options. This week features an optional hands-on exercise for Domain 3, where you compare two AWS database services: Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) and Amazon DynamoDB. An accompanying video walkthrough shows one possible solution for addressing the requirements for the exercise.

### Week 4: Designing Cost-optimized Architectures (Domain 4)

This week, you will review relevant concepts and services on Designing Cost-optimized Architectures (Domain 4) so you can get a benchmark of your knowledge in this area. The question walkthroughs for this domain cover identifying cost-effective storage solutions, selecting compute and database services, and designing cost-optimized network architectures. In this week’s optional exercise, you will launch a pre-written employee directory application on Amazon EC2. The application must be scalable and highly available. This week also includes a practice assessment that includes questions from all exam domains.
