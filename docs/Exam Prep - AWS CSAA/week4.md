# Design Cost-optimized Architectures

Because Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is one of the most popular storage services in AWS, you should have an understanding of the best approach to optimizing Amazon S3 costs—without impacting application performance or adding operational overhead. After you learn the fundamentals to optimizing your S3 storage costs across your entire organization, they aren’t difficult to implement. Whether you have raw data that must be moved, analyzed, or archived—S3 has a storage class that is optimized for your data access, performance, and cost requirements.

To manage your objects so that they are stored cost effectively throughout their lifecycle, configure their S3 Lifecycle. An S3 Lifecycle configuration is a set of rules that define actions that S3 applies to a group of objects.

Operating in the cloud has changed the way that organizations relate to—and account for—their costs. With pay-as-you-go pricing, decentralized resource procurement, and a wider breadth of product functionality, it’s important to re-evaluate the way that you approach IT-based financial processes.

The [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) provides you with a great opportunity to further learn about—and get hands-on experience with—the various services. With the AWS Free Tier, you have the chance to work with database services that you might not have explored yet.

You can make informed decisions to design, modify, or accept architectural decisions by understanding where the data transfer occurs in your workload, the cost of the transfer, and its associated benefits.

AWS Cost Explorer is a tool that you can use to view and analyze your costs and usage. You can explore your usage and costs by using the main graph, the Cost Explorer cost and usage reports, or the Cost Explorer Reserved Instance (RI) reports.
