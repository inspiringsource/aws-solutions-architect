Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service for Apache ActiveMQ that makes it easy to set up and operate message brokers in the cloud. Amazon MQ fully manages the message broker software, including the operating system, hardware, and clustering. You can use Amazon MQ to migrate existing message brokers to the cloud or build new applications that use message brokers.
