## What is AWS Global Accelerator?

AWS Global Accelerator is a network layer service that improves the availability and performance of your applications with local or global users. Global Accelerator directs traffic to optimal endpoints over the AWS global network to improve performance for internet applications used by a global audience. Endpoints can be Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, and Amazon EC2 instances.

Global Accelerator provides you with static IP addresses that you associate with your accelerator. These IP addresses are anycast from the AWS edge network and distribute incoming application traffic across multiple endpoints in multiple AWS Regions, which increases the availability of your applications. Endpoints can be Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, and Amazon EC2 instances.
