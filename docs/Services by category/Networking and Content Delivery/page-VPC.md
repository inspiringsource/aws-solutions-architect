What is Amazon VPC?

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you've defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.

Amazon VPC provides multiple network connectivity options for you to use, depending on your current network designs and requirements. These connectivity options include using either the internet or an AWS Direct Connect connection as the network backbone and terminating the connection into AWS or user-managed network endpoints. Additionally, with AWS, you can choose how network routing is delivered between Amazon VPC and your networks, leveraging either AWS services or user-managed network equipment and routes.
