AWS PrivateLink is a network service that enables you to privately access services hosted on AWS in a VPC without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. Instances in a VPC can communicate with AWS PrivateLink endpoints without exposing the endpoint to the internet. Traffic between your VPC and the endpoint stays within the AWS network and doesn't traverse the internet.
