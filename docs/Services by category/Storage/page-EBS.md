Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides block level storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud. Each Amazon EBS volume is automatically replicated within its Availability Zone to protect you from component failure, offering high availability and durability. You can use Amazon EBS to build high-availability applications that can withstand the failure of underlying hardware. You can also use Amazon EBS to build applications that require fast, predictable, and consistent disk performance.
