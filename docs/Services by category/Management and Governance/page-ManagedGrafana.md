Amazon Managed Grafana is a service that makes it easy to create, operate, and scale Grafana instances to monitor your AWS and on-premises environments. You can use Amazon Managed Grafana to create Grafana instances with your choice of data sources, dashboards, and users. You can also use Amazon Managed Grafana to manage Grafana instances at scale by using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control access to your Grafana instances and by using AWS CloudFormation to automate the creation and deletion of Grafana instances.
