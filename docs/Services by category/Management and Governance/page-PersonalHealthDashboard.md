You can use the AWS Personal Health Dashboard to view events that affect your AWS resources, including events that are related to scheduled maintenance, service issues, and account events. You can also use the AWS Personal Health Dashboard to view events that are related to AWS services that are outside of your AWS account, such as AWS Marketplace, AWS Support, and AWS Trusted Advisor.
