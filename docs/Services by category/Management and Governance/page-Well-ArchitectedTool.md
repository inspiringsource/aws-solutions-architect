The AWS Well-Architected Tool lets you review your workloads against current AWS best practices and obtain advice on how to architect your workloads for the cloud. This tool uses the [AWS Well-Architected Framework](#aws-well-architected-framework). 

## What can I do with the AWS Well-Architected Tool?
You can review workloads against best practices across the Well-Architected Framework, AWS-provided lenses, and custom lenses. The AWS Well-Architected Tool delivers a list of potential issues found in your workloads and provides step-by-step guidance to make improvements. You can also view the potential issues found across your portfolio of workloads. You can tag each workload to help you manage your AWS WA Tool resources and assign your own metadata to each resource. You can also use the AWS Well-Architected Tool to share your workloads with other AWS accounts.

Share workloads and custom lenses that you own with other AWS accounts, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users in the same AWS Region as well as with AWS Organizations. Learn more.
You can also use the Well-Architected APIs to extend AWS Well-Architected functionality, best practices, measurements, and learnings into your existing architecture governance processes, applications, and workflows.
