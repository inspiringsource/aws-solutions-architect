AWS Auto Scaling is a service that automatically adjusts the number of Amazon EC2 instances in your Auto Scaling group to maintain performance at the lowest possible cost. You can use Auto Scaling to scale your Amazon EC2 instances up or down automatically according to conditions you define. For example, you can use Auto Scaling to automatically increase the number of Amazon EC2 instances during peak demand hours and reduce the number of Amazon EC2 instances during off-peak demand hours.
