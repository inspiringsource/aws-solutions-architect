Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and management service for AWS cloud resources and the applications you run on AWS. CloudWatch provides data and actionable insights to monitor your applications, respond to system-wide performance changes, optimize resource utilization, and get a unified view of operational health.

CloudWatch is a collection of services, including:

- CloudWatch Dashboards
- CloudWatch Alarms
- CloudWatch Logs
> Filters do not retroactively filter data. Filters only publish the metric data points for events that happen after the filter was created. 
- CloudWatch Metrics
- CloudWatch Events.
