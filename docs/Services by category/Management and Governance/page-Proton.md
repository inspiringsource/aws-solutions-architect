AWS Proton is a fully managed service that makes it easy to deploy and manage container-based applications on AWS. You can use AWS Proton to create and manage AWS resources, such as AWS Fargate services, AWS Lambda functions, and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) tasks. You can also use AWS Proton to create and manage the infrastructure resources that support your applications, such as Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) clusters, AWS CloudFormation stacks, and AWS CodePipeline pipelines. AWS Proton provides a single, unified view of your applications and the resources that support them.
