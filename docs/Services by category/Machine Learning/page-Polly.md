Amazon Polly is a service that turns text into lifelike speech. Polly is a text-to-speech (TTS) service that uses advanced deep learning technologies to synthesize speech that sounds like a human voice. Polly can synthesize speech from text in 24 different languages and 47 different voices. Polly can also convert text into lifelike speech in real time, enabling you to create applications that talk, and build entirely new categories of speech-enabled products. Polly is easy to use, and there is no machine learning experience required to start using this service. Polly makes it easy for developers to add lifelike speech to their applications, and also makes it easy for developers who have experience building machine learning models to customize and train their own models for specific use cases.
