Serverless applications are applications that are built and run on AWS Lambda, an event-driven, serverless computing platform. AWS Serverless Application Repository makes it easy for developers to quickly deploy serverless applications that are ready to use, with no additional configuration required. AWS Serverless Application Repository also makes it easy for enterprises to share serverless applications with their development teams, and to publish and share their own serverless applications with the community.
