AWS Batch is a batch processing service that enables you to run batch computing workloads on the AWS Cloud. Batch computing is a common way for developers, scientists, and engineers to access large amounts of compute resources, and AWS Batch removes the undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and managing the required infrastructure. AWS Batch can dynamically provision the optimal quantity and type of compute resources (e.g., CPU or memory optimized instances) based on the volume and specific resource requirements of the batch jobs submitted. This means that developers, scientists, and engineers can submit batch jobs of any scale, and AWS Batch will automatically and efficiently provision resources in response, eliminating capacity constraints, reducing compute costs, and delivering results quickly.
