description: Deploy and scale web applications
---

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS. You can use Elastic Beanstalk to quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud without worrying about the infrastructure that runs those applications.

## Source code deployment

Elastic Beanstalk supports the deployment of web applications from source code stored in AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeStar, or GitHub. You can also deploy applications from source code stored in Amazon S3 buckets. For more information, see [Deploying Source Code from AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeStar, or GitHub](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create_deploy_codecommit.html) and [Deploying Source Code from Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create_deploy_s3.html).

## Docker container deployment

Elastic Beanstalk supports the deployment of web applications from Docker containers. You can use Elastic Beanstalk to deploy and manage Docker containers on Amazon EC2 instances or on AWS Fargate. You can also use Elastic Beanstalk to deploy and manage Docker containers on Amazon ECS clusters. For more information, see [Deploying Docker Containers on AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create_deploy_docker.html).
