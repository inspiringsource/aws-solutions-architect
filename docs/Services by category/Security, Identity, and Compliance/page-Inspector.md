Amazon Inspector is a vulnerability management service that continuously scans your AWS workloads for vulnerabilities. Amazon Inspector automatically discovers and scans Amazon EC2 instances and container images residing in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure.

When a software vulnerability or network issue is discovered, Amazon Inspector creates a finding. A finding describes the vulnerability, identifies the affected resource, rates the severity of the vulnerability, and provides remediation guidance. Details of a finding for your account can be analyzed in multiple ways using the Amazon Inspector console, or you can view and process your findings through other AWS services. For more information, see Understanding findings in Amazon Inspector.
