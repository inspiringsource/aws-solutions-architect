Amazon Detective is a fully managed service that makes it easy to analyze and investigate security issues across your AWS workloads. Amazon Detective automatically collects and aggregates data from AWS CloudTrail, Amazon VPC Flow Logs, and Amazon GuardDuty, and provides a unified view of potential security issues. You can use the Detective console to visualize and analyze data, and to identify potential security issues. You can also use the Detective API to automate the analysis of your data. Amazon Detective is free to use. You pay only for the AWS resources that you create while using Detective, such as Amazon S3 buckets and Amazon CloudWatch log groups.
