AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM) helps you securely share the AWS resources that you create in one AWS account with other AWS accounts. If you have multiple AWS accounts, you can create a resource once and use AWS RAM to make that resource usable by those other accounts. If your account is managed by AWS Organizations, then you can share resources with all the other accounts in the organization, or only those accounts contained by one or more specified organizational units (OUs). You can also share with specific AWS accounts by account ID, regardless of whether the account is part of an organization. Some supported resource types also let you share them with specified IAM roles and users.
