Amazon Macie is a (serverless) fully managed data security and data privacy service that uses machine learning and pattern matching to help you discover, monitor, and protect sensitive data in your AWS environment.

Macie automates the discovery of sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII) and financial data, to provide you with a better understanding of the data that your organization stores in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). Macie also provides you with an inventory of your S3 buckets, and it automatically evaluates and monitors those buckets for security and access control. Within minutes, Macie can identify and report overly permissive or unencrypted buckets for your organization.

If Macie detects sensitive data or potential issues with the security or privacy of your data, it creates detailed findings for you to review and remediate as necessary. You can review and analyze these findings directly in Macie, or monitor and process them by using other services, applications, and systems.

### Further use cases

Macie can detect sensitive data in Amazon DynamoDB tables by exporting the data to Amazon S3 so that Macie can scan the data.
