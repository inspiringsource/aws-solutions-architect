<h3 align="center">"AWS IAM Identity Center is the successor to AWS Single Sign-On (AWS SSO)."</h3>

IAM Identity Center is built on top of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to simplify access management to multiple AWS accounts, AWS applications, and other SAML-enabled cloud applications. In IAM Identity Center, you create, or connect, your workforce users for use across AWS. You can choose to manage access just to your AWS accounts, just to your cloud applications, or to both. You can create users directly in IAM Identity Center, or you can bring them from your existing workforce directory. With IAM Identity Center, you get a unified administration experience to define, customize, and assign fine-grained access. Your workforce users get a user portal to access their assigned AWS accounts or cloud applications.
