AWS Network Firewall is a stateful, managed, network firewall and intrusion detection and prevention service for your virtual private cloud (VPC) that you created in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC).

With Network Firewall, you can filter traffic at the perimeter of your VPC. This includes filtering traffic going to and coming from an internet gateway, NAT gateway, or over VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Network Firewall uses the open source intrusion prevention system (IPS), Suricata, for stateful inspection. Network Firewall supports Suricata compatible rules. For more information, see Working with stateful rule groups in AWS Network Firewall.

You can use Network Firewall to monitor and protect your Amazon VPC traffic in a number of ways, including the following:

* Pass traffic through only from known AWS service domains or IP address endpoints, such as Amazon S3.

* Use custom lists of known bad domains to limit the types of domain names that your applications can access.

* Perform deep packet inspection on traffic entering or leaving your VPC.

* Use stateful protocol detection to filter protocols like HTTPS, independent of the port used.
