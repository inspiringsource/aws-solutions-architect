AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is a managed service that makes it easy for you to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data, and uses Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) to protect the security of your keys.


## key management features available in AWS KMS?

- Create symmetric and asymmetric keys where the key material is only ever used within the service
- Create symmetric keys where the key material is generated and used within a custom key store under your control*
- Import your own symmetric key material for use within the service
- Create both symmetric and asymmetric data key pairs for local use within your applications
- Define which IAM users and roles can manage keys
- Define which IAM users and roles can use keys to encrypt and decrypt data
- Choose to have keys that were generated by the service to be automatically rotated on an annual basis
- Temporarily disable keys so they cannot be used by anyone
- Re-enable disabled keys
- Schedule the deletion of keys that you no longer use
- Audit use of keys by inspecting logs in AWS CloudTrail
*The use of custom key stores requires CloudHSM resources to be available in your account.


## Good to know

Key Management Service (KMS) provides envelope encryption which directly integrates into multiple AWS services so you can easily apply encyption-at-rest to your data. KMS also provides a set of APIs that you can use to encrypt and decrypt data outside of AWS.
