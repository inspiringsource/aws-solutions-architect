<p align="center">Securely generate, store, and manage cryptographic keys</p>

AWS CloudHSM provides hardware security modules in the AWS Cloud. A hardware security module (HSM) is a computing device that processes cryptographic operations and provides secure storage for cryptographic keys.

When you use an HSM from AWS CloudHSM, you can perform a variety of cryptographic tasks:

* Generate, store, import, export, and manage cryptographic keys, including symmetric keys and asymmetric key pairs.

* Use symmetric and asymmetric algorithms to encrypt and decrypt data.

* Use cryptographic hash functions to compute message digests and hash-based message authentication codes (HMACs).

* Cryptographically sign data (including code signing) and verify signatures.

* Generate cryptographically secure random data.
