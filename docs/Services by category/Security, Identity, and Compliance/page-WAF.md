AWS WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to your protected web application resources. You can protect the following resource types:

* Amazon CloudFront distribution

* Amazon API Gateway REST API

* Application Load Balancer

* AWS AppSync GraphQL API

* Amazon Cognito user pool

AWS WAF also lets you control access to your content. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, your protected resource responds to requests either with the requested content, with an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden), or with a custom response.
