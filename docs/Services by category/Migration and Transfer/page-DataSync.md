AWS DataSync is an online data movement and discovery service that simplifies and accelerates data migrations to AWS as well as moving data between on-premises storage, edge locations, other clouds, and AWS Storage.

### Why should I use AWS DataSync?

AWS DataSync enables you to discover and move your data, securely and quickly. Using DataSync Discovery (Preview), you can better understand your on-premises storage utilization and receive recommendations to inform your cost estimates and plans for migrating to AWS. For data movement, you can use DataSync to copy large datasets with millions of files, without having to build custom solutions with open-source tools, or license and manage expensive commercial network acceleration software. You can use DataSync to migrate active data to AWS, archive data to free up on-premises storage capacity, replicate data to AWS for business continuity, or transfer data to the cloud for analysis and processing.

### Use cases
These are some of the main use cases for DataSync:

* Data migration – Move active datasets rapidly over the network into Amazon S3, Amazon EFS, FSx for Windows File Server, FSx for Lustre, or FSx for OpenZFS. DataSync includes automatic encryption and data integrity validation to help make sure that your data arrives securely, intact, and ready to use.

* Archiving cold data – Move cold data stored in on-premises storage directly to durable and secure long-term storage classes such as S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive. Doing so can free up on-premises storage capacity and shut down legacy systems.

* Data protection – Move data into any Amazon S3 storage class, choosing the most cost-effective storage class for your needs. You can also send data to Amazon EFS, FSx for Windows File Server, FSx for Lustre, or FSx for OpenZFS for a standby file system.

* Data movement for timely in-cloud processing – Move data in or out of AWS for processing. This approach can speed up critical hybrid cloud workflows across many industries. These include machine learning in the life-sciences industry, video production in media and entertainment, big-data analytics in financial services, and seismic research in the oil and gas industry.
