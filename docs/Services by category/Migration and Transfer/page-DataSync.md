AWS DataSync is an online data movement and discovery service that simplifies and accelerates data migrations to AWS as well as moving data between on-premises storage, edge locations, other clouds, and AWS Storage.

### Why should I use AWS DataSync?

AWS DataSync enables you to discover and move your data, securely and quickly. Using DataSync Discovery (Preview), you can better understand your on-premises storage utilization and receive recommendations to inform your cost estimates and plans for migrating to AWS. For data movement, you can use DataSync to copy large datasets with millions of files, without having to build custom solutions with open-source tools, or license and manage expensive commercial network acceleration software. You can use DataSync to migrate active data to AWS, archive data to free up on-premises storage capacity, replicate data to AWS for business continuity, or transfer data to the cloud for analysis and processing.
