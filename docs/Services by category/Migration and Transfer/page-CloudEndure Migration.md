AWS Application Migration Service (AWS MGN) is the recommended service for migrations to AWS. AWS Application Migration Service simplifies and expedites your migration to AWS by automatically converting your source servers from physical, virtual, or cloud infrastructure to run natively on AWS. It further simplifies your migration and reduces costs by allowing you to use the same automated process for a wide range of applications, without changes to applications, their architecture, or the migrated servers. You can use AWS Application Migration Service to perform non-disruptive tests prior to cutover. After testing, you can use AWS Application Migration Service to quickly migrate your applications to the cloud during a short cutover window, typically measured in minutes. You can also use AWS Application Migration Service to automate application modernizations on your migrated servers.
