AWS Migration Hub provides access to the tools you need to collect and inventory your existing IT assets based on actual usage, analyze application components and infrastructure dependencies, and group resources into applications. You can generate migration strategy and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance recommendations for business case and migration planning, track the progress of application migrations to AWS, and modernize applications already running on AWS.
