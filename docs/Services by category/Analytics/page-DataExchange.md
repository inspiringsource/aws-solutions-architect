Purchase and subscribe to data from third-party sources then use sagemaker to connect to it and start building machine learning models.  

AWS Data Exchange is a new service that makes it easy for AWS customers to securely find, subscribe to, and use third-party data in the cloud. AWS Data Exchange is integrated with AWS Marketplace, AWS Organizations, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), and AWS CloudTrail to help customers discover, subscribe to, and use third-party data in the cloud. AWS Data Exchange also provides a central location for customers to manage their data subscriptions and access rights.

AWS Data Exchange is the only data marketplace with more than 3,000 products from 250 providers delivered —through files, APIs, or Amazon Redshift queries— directly to the data lakes, applications, analytics, and machine learning models that use it.
With AWS Data Exchange, you can streamline all third-party data consumption, from existing subscriptions —which you can migrate at no additional cost to you or the provider— to future data subscriptions, in one place.
As an AWS service, AWS Data Exchange is secure and compliant, integrated with AWS and third-party tools and services, and offers consolidated billing and subscription management.
