## Amazon Athena is serverless

Athena is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to manage, and you pay only for the queries that you run

Immediately start querying using the built-in query editor. You can also use AWS Glue to automatically crawl data sources to discover data and populate your Data Catalog. Results are displayed in the console within seconds, and automatically stored in S3.
