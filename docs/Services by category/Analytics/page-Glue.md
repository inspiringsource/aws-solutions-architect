AWS Glue is a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that makes it easy for customers to prepare and load their data for analytics. AWS Glue is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to manage, and you pay only for the resources you use.

You use the AWS Glue console to define and orchestrate your ETL workflow. The console calls several API operations in the AWS Glue Data Catalog and AWS Glue Jobs system to perform the following tasks:

* Define AWS Glue objects such as jobs, tables, crawlers, and connections.

* Schedule when crawlers run.

* Define events or schedules for job triggers.

* Search and filter lists of AWS Glue objects.

* Edit transformation scripts.
