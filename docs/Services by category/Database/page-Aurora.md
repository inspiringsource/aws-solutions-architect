Amazon Aurora is a fully managed, MySQL- and PostgreSQL-compatible, relational databas
engine. It combines the speed and reliability of high-end commercial databases with th
simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open-source databases. It delivers up to fiv
times the throughput of MySQL and up to three times the throughput of PostgreSQ
without requiring changes to most of your existing applications.

## Aurora security
Amazon Aurora provides built-in security, continuous backups, serverless compute, up to 15 read replicas, automated multi-Region replication, and integrations with other AWS services.

## Aurora Replicas

When you create a second, third, and so on DB instance in an Aurora provisioned DB cluster, Aurora automatically sets up replication from the writer DB instance to all the other DB instances. These other DB instances are read-only and are known as Aurora Replicas. We also refer to them as reader instances when discussing the ways that you can combine writer and reader DB instances within a cluster.
