Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks, freeing up developers to focus on what makes their applications and businesses unique.

## RDS is a managed service

RDS is a managed service, which means Amazon takes care of patching, backups, and maintenance for you. You can use RDS to deploy and scale popular database engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and Amazon Aurora. You can also use RDS to deploy and scale a database in the cloud that is compatible with your existing on-premises applications.
