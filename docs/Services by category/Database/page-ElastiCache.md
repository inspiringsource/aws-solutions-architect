Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale an in-memory cache in the cloud. The service improves the performance of web applications by allowing you to retrieve information from fast, managed, in-memory caches, instead of relying entirely on slower disk-based databases. ElastiCache can launch either Memcached or Redis cache clusters. 

## Memcached

Memcached is an open-source, high-performance, distributed memory object caching system. It is often referred to as a caching daemon. Memcached is a simple, yet powerful tool that can be used to speed up dynamic database-driven websites by caching data and objects in memory to reduce the number of times an external data source (such as a database or API) must be read.

## Redis

Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes with radius queries and streams. Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions and different levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster.
