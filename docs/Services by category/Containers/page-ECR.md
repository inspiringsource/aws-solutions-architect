Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is a fully managed Docker container registry that makes it easy for developers to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images. Amazon ECR provides both public and private registries to host your container images. You can use the familiar Docker CLI, or their preferred client, to push, pull, and manage images. Amazon ECR integrates with IAM to provide resource-level permissions, allowing you to control who can access your repositories and images.
