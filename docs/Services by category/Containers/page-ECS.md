Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster. Your containers are defined in a task definition that you use to run individual tasks or tasks within a service.

Your Amazon ECS tasks can have an IAM role associated with them. The permissions granted in the IAM role are assumed by the containers running in the task. [IAM roles for tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html)
