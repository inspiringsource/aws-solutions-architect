Amazon ECS Anywhere is a deployment option for Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) that allows you to run containers on your on-premises servers or virtual machines (VMs). You can use Amazon ECS Anywhere to run containers on your existing on-premises infrastructure, and then migrate your workloads to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) or to AWS Fargate. You can also use Amazon ECS Anywhere to run containers on your on-premises infrastructure and then migrate your workloads to AWS Outposts.
