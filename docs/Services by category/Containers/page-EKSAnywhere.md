Amazon EKS Anywhere is a deployment option for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) that allows you to run Kubernetes on your on-premises servers or virtual machines (VMs). You can use Amazon EKS Anywhere to run Kubernetes on your existing on-premises infrastructure, and then migrate your workloads to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) or to AWS Fargate. You can also use Amazon EKS Anywhere to run Kubernetes on your on-premises infrastructure and then migrate your workloads to AWS Outposts.
