AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR) is a service that lets you create and manage reports that show your AWS usage, including your monthly AWS bill and service usage, broken down by account, service, and resource. You can use these reports to track your AWS costs and usage over time, and to identify ways to reduce your costs. You can also use these reports to create budgets and set alerts to help you stay on top of your costs.
