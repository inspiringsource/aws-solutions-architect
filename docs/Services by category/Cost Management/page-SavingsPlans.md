Savings Plans are a pricing model that provides a significant discount (up to 72%) on Amazon EC2 usage, as compared to On-Demand prices. You commit to a consistent amount of usage, in USD per hour, for a term of 1 or 3 years, and receive a lower usage rate as a result. Savings Plans are available for Amazon EC2, Amazon ECS, and AWS Lambda.
