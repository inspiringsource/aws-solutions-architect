## Supports Cross-Region Replication


Cross-Region Replication (CRR) is a feature that enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across S3 buckets. You can use CRR to replicate objects to another bucket in the same AWS Region or to a bucket in a different AWS Region. You can also use CRR to replicate objects to an Amazon S3 Outposts bucket.

Amazon S3 supports Cross-Region Replication. With Cross-Region Replication, you designate a destination S3 bucket in another Region. When Cross-Region Replication is turned on, any new object that is uploaded will be replicated to the destination S3 bucket.


Use the "Create Read Replica" option corresponding to your DB with Amazon RDS to replicate any data from the primary DB instance to the read replica across Regions.
