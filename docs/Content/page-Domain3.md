AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C03)

## Domain 3: Design High-Performance Architectures

### A. Determine high-performing and/or scalable storage solutions. 
 
Knowledge of: 
*   Hybrid storage solutions to meet business requirements  
*   Storage services with appropriate use cases (for example, Amazon S3, Amazon Elastic File System [Amazon EFS], Amazon Elastic Block Store [Amazon EBS]) 
*   Storage types with associated characteristics (for example, object, file, block) 
Skills in: 
*   Determining storage services and configurations that meet performance demands 
*   Determining storage services that can scale to accommodate future needs 
 
### B. Design high-performing and elastic compute solutions. 
 
Knowledge of: 
*   AWS compute services with appropriate use cases (for example, AWS Batch, Amazon EMR, Fargate)  
*   Distributed computing concepts supported by AWS global infrastructure and edge services 
*   Queuing and messaging concepts (for example, publish/subscribe) 
*   Scalability capabilities with appropriate use cases (for example, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, AWS Auto Scaling) 
*   Serverless technologies and patterns (for example, Lambda, Fargate) 
*   The orchestration of containers (for example, Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS) 
 
Skills in: 
*   Decoupling workloads so that components can scale independently 
*   Identifying metrics and conditions to perform scaling actions 
*   Selecting the appropriate compute options and features (for example, EC2 instance types) to meet business requirements 
*   Selecting the appropriate resource type and size (for example, the amount of Lambda memory) to meet business requirements 
 
### C. Determine high-performing database solutions. 
 
Knowledge of: 
*   AWS global infrastructure (for example, Availability Zones, AWS Regions) 
*   Caching strategies and services (for example, Amazon ElastiCache) 
*   Data access patterns (for example, read-intensive compared with write-intensive) 
*   Database capacity planning (for example, capacity units, instance types, Provisioned IOPS) 
*   Database connections and proxies 
*   Database engines with appropriate use cases (for example, heterogeneous migrations, homogeneous migrations) 
*   Database replication (for example, read replicas) 
*   Database types and services (for example, serverless, relational compared with non-relational, in-memory) 
 
Skills in: 
*   Configuring read replicas to meet business requirements 
*   Designing database architectures 
*   Determining an appropriate database engine (for example, MySQL compared with PostgreSQL) 
*   Determining an appropriate database type (for example, Amazon Aurora, Amazon DynamoDB) 
*   Integrating caching to meet business requirements 
### D. Determine high-performing and/or scalable network architectures. 
 
Knowledge of: 
*   Edge networking services with appropriate use cases (for example, Amazon CloudFront, AWS Global Accelerator)  
*   How to design network architecture (for example, subnet tiers, routing, IP addressing) 
*   Load balancing concepts (for example, Application Load Balancer) 
*   Network connection options (for example, AWS VPN, Direct Connect, AWS PrivateLink) 
 
Skills in: 
*   Creating a network topology for various architectures (for example, global, hybrid, multi-tier)  
*   Determining network configurations that can scale to accommodate future needs 
*   Determining the appropriate placement of resources to meet business requirements 
*   Selecting the appropriate load balancing strategy  
 
### E. Determine high-performing data ingestion and transformation solutions. 
 
Knowledge of: 
*   Data analytics and visualization services with appropriate use cases (for example, Amazon Athena, AWS Lake Formation, Amazon QuickSight) 
*   Data ingestion patterns (for example, frequency) 
*   Data transfer services with appropriate use cases (for example, AWS DataSync, AWS Storage Gateway)  
*   Data transformation services with appropriate use cases (for example, AWS Glue)  
*   Secure access to ingestion access points 
*   Sizes and speeds needed to meet business requirements 
*   Streaming data services with appropriate use cases (for example, Amazon Kinesis) 
 
Skills in: 
*   Building and securing data lakes 
*   Designing data streaming architectures  
*   Designing data transfer solutions 
*   Implementing visualization strategies 
*   Selecting appropriate compute options for data processing (for example, Amazon EMR) 
*   Selecting appropriate configurations for ingestion 
*   Transforming data between formats (for example, .csv to .parquet)
