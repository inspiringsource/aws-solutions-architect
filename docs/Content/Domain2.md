AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C03)

## Domain 2: Design Resilient Architectures  
### A. Design scalable and loosely coupled architectures. 
 
Knowledge of: 
*	API creation and management (for example, Amazon API Gateway, REST API) 
*	AWS managed services with appropriate use cases (for example, AWS Transfer Family, Amazon Simple Queue Service [Amazon SQS], Secrets Manager) 
*	Caching strategies 
*	Design principles for microservices (for example, stateless workloads compared with stateful workloads) 
*	Event-driven architectures  
*	Horizontal scaling and vertical scaling 
*	How to appropriately use edge accelerators (for example, content delivery network [CDN]) 
*	How to migrate applications into containers 
*	Load balancing concepts (for example, Application Load Balancer) 
*	Multi-tier architectures 
*	Queuing and messaging concepts (for example, publish/subscribe) 
*	Serverless technologies and patterns (for example, AWS Fargate, AWS Lambda) 
*	Storage types with associated characteristics (for example, object, file, block) 
*	The orchestration of containers (for example, Amazon Elastic Container Service [Amazon ECS], Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service [Amazon EKS]) 
*	When to use read replicas  
*	Workflow orchestration (for example, AWS Step Functions) 
  	 
Skills in: 
*	Designing event-driven, microservice, and/or multi-tier architectures based on requirements 
*	Determining scaling strategies for components used in an architecture design 
*	Determining the AWS services required to achieve loose coupling based on requirements 
*	Determining when to use containers  
*	Determining when to use serverless technologies and patterns 
*	Recommending appropriate compute, storage, networking, and database technologies based on requirements 
*	Using purpose-built AWS services for workloads 
 
### B. Design highly available and/or fault-tolerant architectures. 
 
Knowledge of: 
*	AWS global infrastructure (for example, Availability Zones, AWS Regions, Amazon Route 53) 
*	AWS managed services with appropriate use cases (for example, Amazon Comprehend, Amazon Polly) 
*	Basic networking concepts (for example, route tables) 
*	Disaster recovery (DR) strategies (for example, backup and restore, pilot light, warm standby, active-active failover, recovery point objective [RPO], recovery time objective [RTO]) 
*	Distributed design patterns 
*	Failover strategies  
*	Immutable infrastructure 
*	Load balancing concepts (for example, Application Load Balancer) 
*	Proxy concepts (for example, Amazon RDS Proxy) 
*	Service quotas and throttling (for example, how to configure the service quotas for a workload in a standby environment) 
*	Storage options and characteristics (for example, durability, replication) 
*	Workload visibility (for example, AWS X-Ray) 
 
Skills in: 
*	Determining automation strategies to ensure infrastructure integrity 
*	Determining the AWS services required to provide a highly available and/or fault-tolerant architecture across AWS Regions or Availability Zones 
*	Identifying metrics based on business requirements to deliver a highly available solution 
*	Implementing designs to mitigate single points of failure 
*	Implementing strategies to ensure the durability and availability of data (for example, backups) * 	Selecting an appropriate DR strategy to meet business requirements 
*	Using AWS services that improve the reliability of legacy applications and applications not built for the cloud (for example, when application changes are not possible) 
*	Using purpose-built AWS services for workloads
