### Task Statement 1. Design cost-optimized storage solutions. 
 
Knowledge of: 
*   Access options (for example, an S3 bucket with Requester Pays object storage) 
*   AWS cost management service features (for example, cost allocation tags, multi-account billing) 
*   AWS cost management tools with appropriate use cases (for example, AWS Cost Explorer, AWS Budgets, AWS Cost and Usage Report) 
*   AWS storage services with appropriate use cases (for example, Amazon FSx, Amazon EFS, Amazon S3, Amazon EBS) 
*   Backup strategies 
*   Block storage options (for example, hard disk drive [HDD] volume types, solid state drive [SSD] volume types) 
*   Data lifecycles 
*   Hybrid storage options (for example, DataSync, Transfer Family, Storage Gateway) 
*   Storage access patterns 
*   Storage tiering (for example, cold tiering for object storage) 
*   Storage types with associated characteristics (for example, object, file, block) 
 
Skills in: 
*   Designing appropriate storage strategies (for example, batch uploads to Amazon S3 compared with individual uploads) 
*   Determining the correct storage size for a workload 
*   Determining the lowest cost method of transferring data for a workload to AWS storage 
*   Determining when storage auto scaling is required  
*   Managing S3 object lifecycles 
*   Selecting the appropriate backup and/or archival solution 
*   Selecting the appropriate service for data migration to storage services 
*   Selecting the appropriate storage tier  
*   Selecting the correct data lifecycle for storage 
*   Selecting the most cost-effective storage service for a workload 
  	 
### Task Statement 2. Design cost-optimized compute solutions. 
 
Knowledge of: 
*   AWS cost management service features (for example, cost allocation tags, multi-account billing) 
*   AWS cost management tools with appropriate use cases (for example, Cost Explorer, AWS Budgets, AWS Cost and Usage Report) 
*   AWS global infrastructure (for example, Availability Zones, AWS Regions) 
*   AWS purchasing options (for example, Spot Instances, Reserved Instances, Savings Plans) 
*   Distributed compute strategies (for example, edge processing) 
*   Hybrid compute options (for example, AWS Outposts, AWS Snowball Edge) 
*   Instance types, families, and sizes (for example, memory optimized, compute optimized, virtualization) 
*   Optimization of compute utilization (for example, containers, serverless computing, microservices) 
*   Scaling strategies (for example, auto scaling, hibernation) 
 
Skills in: 
*   Determining an appropriate load balancing strategy (for example, Application Load Balancer [Layer 7] compared with Network Load Balancer [Layer 4] compared with Gateway Load Balancer) 
*   Determining appropriate scaling methods and strategies for elastic workloads (for example, horizontal compared with vertical, EC2 hibernation) 
*   Determining cost-effective AWS compute services with appropriate use cases (for example, Lambda, Amazon EC2, Fargate) 
*   Determining the required availability for different classes of workloads (for example, production workloads, non-production workloads) 
*   Selecting the appropriate instance family for a workload 
*   Selecting the appropriate instance size for a workload 
 
### Task Statement 3. Design cost-optimized database solutions. 
 
Knowledge of: 
*   AWS cost management service features (for example, cost allocation tags, multi-account billing)

*   Caching strategies 
*   Data retention policies 
*   Database capacity planning (for example, capacity units) 
*   Database connections and proxies 
*   Database engines with appropriate use cases (for example, heterogeneous migrations, homogeneous migrations) 
*   Database replication (for example, read replicas) 
*   Database types and services (for example, relational compared with non-relational, Aurora, DynamoDB)  	 
Skills in: 
*   Designing appropriate backup and retention policies (for example, snapshot frequency) 
*   Determining an appropriate database engine (for example, MySQL compared with PostgreSQL)
