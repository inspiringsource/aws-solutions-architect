AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C03)


## Domain 1: Design Secure Architectures  
### A. Design secure access to AWS resources.  
 
Knowledge of: 
*	Access controls and management across multiple accounts 
*	AWS federated access and identity services (for example, AWS Identity and Access Management [IAM], AWS Single Sign-On [AWS SSO]) 
*	AWS global infrastructure (for example, Availability Zones, AWS Regions) 
*	AWS security best practices (for example, the principle of least privilege) 
*	The AWS shared responsibility model 
 
Skills in: 
*	Applying AWS security best practices to IAM users and root users (for example, multi-factor authentication [MFA]) 
*	Designing a flexible authorization model that includes IAM users, groups, roles, and policies 
*	Designing a role-based access control strategy (for example, AWS Security Token Service [AWS STS], role switching, cross-account access) 
*	Designing a security strategy for multiple AWS accounts (for example, AWS Control Tower, service control policies [SCPs]) 
*	Determining the appropriate use of resource policies for AWS services * 	Determining when to federate a directory service with IAM roles 
 
### Task Statement 1. Design secure workloads and applications. 
 
Knowledge of: 
*	Application configuration and credentials security 
*	AWS service endpoints 
*	Control ports, protocols, and network traffic on AWS 
*	Secure application access 
*	Security services with appropriate use cases (for example, Amazon Cognito, Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Macie) 
*	Threat vectors external to AWS (for example, DDoS, SQL injection) 
 
Skills in: 
*	Designing VPC architectures with security components (for example, security groups, route tables, network ACLs, NAT gateways) 
*	Determining network segmentation strategies (for example, using public subnets and private subnets) 
*	Integrating AWS services to secure applications (for example, AWS Shield, AWS WAF, AWS SSO, AWS Secrets Manager) 
*	Securing external network connections to and from the AWS Cloud (for example, VPN, AWS Direct Connect) 
 
 	 
### Task Statement 2. Determine appropriate data security controls. 
 
Knowledge of: 
*	Data access and governance 
*	Data recovery 
*	Data retention and classification 
*	Encryption and appropriate key management 
 
Skills in: 
*	Aligning AWS technologies to meet compliance requirements 
*	Encrypting data at rest (for example, AWS Key Management Service [AWS KMS]) 
*	Encrypting data in transit (for example, AWS Certificate Manager [ACM] using TLS) 
*	Implementing access policies for encryption keys 
*	Implementing data backups and replications 
*	Implementing policies for data access, lifecycle, and protection 
*	Rotating encryption keys and renewing certificates
