## We Develop with Github

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Revise the documentation in the `docs` folder.
3. Issue that pull request!

3. Add the resource to the appropriate section.

## Report bugs or Broken Links using Github's [issues](https://github.com/inspiringsource/aws-solutions-architect/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs or Broken Links. Report by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/inspiringsource/aws-solutions-architect/issues/new); it's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:
