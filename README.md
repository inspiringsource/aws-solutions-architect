# About

The unofficial documentation for AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate.      
I am working on this website during my preparation for the exam. The goal is to have a website that contains all the information in simple and easy to understand terms. I will be adding more content as I go through the exam preparation. As I keep adding more content, I will be updating the website to make it more user friendly. Adding search functionality and improving the documentâ€™s structure.

# AWS hosting solutions

Reviewing AWS hosting solutions, these are the essential services to host a website on AWS. Some of the services are not mentioned e.g. AWS Route 53, VPC, and IAM... We cover these services in the handbook in more detail.


## AWS Amplify solution

AWS Amplify provides a complete backend and frontend cloud development platform with powerful tools for app development, including continuous integration and delivery. With Amplify, you can easily create and manage a scalable, secure and high-performing web application. Additionally, Amplify uses CloudFront by default to distribute your content globally and improve the performance of your application. With CloudFront, you can also protect your application against DDoS attacks and reduce the load on your server. This setup eliminates the need to manually configure CloudFront, hence the below architecture diagram does not include CloudFront.

For application hosting you can also choose to use AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS OpsWorks, or AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS). For more information, see [AWS Application Hosting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/application-hosting.html).
### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Using SSH:

```
$ USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

Not using SSH:

```
$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
