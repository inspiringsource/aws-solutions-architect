The unofficial documentation for AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate.
I am working on this website during my prepartion for the exam. The goal is to have a website that contains all the information in simple and easy to understand terms. I will be adding more content as I go through the exam preparation. As i keep adding more content, I will be updating the website to make it more user friendly. Adding search functionality and imporove the documents structure.       
[edit]         
The website has reached an early stage of production. 

# Status:

- [x] Development hosted on Netlify
- [x] Early production hosted on AWS Amplify


# AWS Amplify solution

The following is the simplest architecture to support the build stages in production using AWS Amplify everthing is basically managed automatically. From git push to the website deployment.

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Using SSH:

```
$ USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

Not using SSH:

```
$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
