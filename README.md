The unofficial documentation for AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate.
I am working on this website during my preparation for the exam. The goal is to have a website that contains all the information in simple and easy to understand terms. I will be adding more content as I go through the exam preparation. As I keep adding more content, I will be updating the website to make it more user friendly. Adding search functionality and improving the documentâ€™s structure.

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Using SSH:

```
$ USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

Not using SSH:

```
$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
