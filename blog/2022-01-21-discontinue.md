Dear readers,

Happy New Year! We hope this message finds you well and that you had a wonderful holiday season. We wanted to let you know that we have decided to discontinue our blog posting on our AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate Practical Handbook website. However, we will continue to post updates and discussions on our GitHub forum.

We apologize for not having posted since last year and want to thank you for your patience. We have enjoyed sharing our knowledge and experiences with you through our blog, but we believe that the GitHub discussion forum will provide a better platform for ongoing discussions and engagement with our readers and the community.

We would like to thank you for your support and interest in our content. We look forward to continuing our conversations on GitHub and hope to see you there.

Please note that all future announcements will be made on the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/inspiringsource/aws-solutions-architect/discussions) forum.

Best regards,

Avi
