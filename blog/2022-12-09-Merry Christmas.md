To help me stay focused and on track I will keep working on this website. I will try to add more and review existing content. My study plan is to make use of any available resources which I plan to share with you in the [Complementary resources](docs/complementary-resources) page and hopefully you will find them useful as well.


I hope you all are having a happy holiday season.
